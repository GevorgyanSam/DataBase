                    <h2>Can electrical stimulation improve your gym workout?</h2>
                    <p>The first time that long-distance rower Lebby Eyres tried exercising in the gym while wearing a whole-body electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) suit, she says "it felt strange".</p>
                    <p>"I got into the suit, and then trainers sprayed me with water, and strapped these things around my arms, legs and glutes (buttocks)," says the 51-year-old. "I thought to myself, 'am I really going to be able to exercise wearing these?'</p>
                    <p>"Then the [electrical] stimulus of the machine gave me the most unusual sensations."</p>
                    <p>When she woke up the following morning at home in London, Mrs Eyres says her muscles had the level of soreness that she typically got from working out for a few hours, yet she had only exercised for 20 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Using low currents of electricity to stimulate muscles and nerves, it is also often used by mothers during childbirth, in the form of a piece of equipment called a tens machine, to try to alleviate the pain. This sees the woman fix sticky pads to her lower back, and then use a hand-held controller to adjust the level of electrical charge that the pads emit.</p>
                    <p>While those health usages typically focus on one area of the body, whole-body EMS suits (which typically comprise a short-sleeved top and shorts) are now a fast-growing trend in the fitness and gym world.</p>
                    <h2>Drax: UK power station owner cuts down primary forests in Canada</h2>
                    <p>By Joe Crowley and Tim Robinson BBC Panorama</p>
                    <p>A company that has received billions of pounds in green energy subsidies from UK taxpayers is cutting down environmentally-important forests, a BBC Panorama investigation has found.</p>
                    <p>Drax runs Britain's biggest power station, which burns millions of tonnes of imported wood pellets - which is classed as renewable energy. The BBC has discovered some of the wood comes from primary forests in Canada.</p>
                    <p>The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.</p>
                    <p>Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest.</p>
                    <p>Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop.</p>
                    <p>"It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.</p>
                    <p>The Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.</p>
                    <p>It has already received Â£6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists.</p>
